main surface + sidebar surface ^

send and receive moves ^  send format: s_pos, e_pos, promo_piece, game_res
waiting and assign color logic ^

changed the winning condition to king capture 
change what each player can see

problem: in the online normal mode, neither client is send nor receiving moves. In fow, sometimes, one player can't make move on their turns (why?)
connect_server is threaded, other send/receive function interfere with it?
avoid sending two messages consecutively
stuck on white move 3?

when the other user connected while p0 is selecting code it might cause a problem. The other player may enter connection mode but the server would not accept.

fluid dynamics? physics modeling?
